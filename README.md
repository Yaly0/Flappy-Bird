# Flappy-Bird

This project is a simple form of the mobile game Flappy Bird, 
using a low-cost microcontroller with a joystick module for controlling and a small RGB display for displaying the game.

This project was made for the "Embedded Systems" course by me and my colleague Nedim Šišić, 
testing the program/code was limited to lab time (90 minutes) once a week for three weeks, 
and there wasn't any simulating software at the time (like simulator.mbed.com now).

## Hardware
- Microcontroller

  We could use two microcontrollers: Freescale FRDM-KL25Z and 
[LPC1114FN28ETF](https://c2.etf.unsa.ba/pluginfile.php/40301/mod_resource/content/0/PinmapLPC1114ETFveliki.png) (based on LPC1114FN28, made by our faculty), 
we chose the LPC1114FN28ETF because the FRDM-KL25Z couldn't run the program/code because it was big for the FRDM-KL25Z.

- Keyes SJoys joystick module
- Banggood 240x320 pixel TFT RGB display
- Connecting scheme is shown in the picture below:

## Software
Mbed platform was used for programming the game, which uses C and C++ programming languages, for LPC1114FN28ETF microcontroller, 
instead of only transferring the .bin file that was generated by Mbed by USB (the procedure for programming FRDM-KL25Z), 
the .bin file has to be converted to a .hex file and then flashed by FlashMagic to the board.
